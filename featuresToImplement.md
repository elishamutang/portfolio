[Features]

1. Change projects page to become a carousel so portfolio can be a 1 page site.
2. I want to be able to update my projects through a CMS that fetches my GitHub repos.
3. Possible re-design of portfolio to become more minimal.

[Issues]

1. Currently the projects page is loading very slow (~2s load time). Maybe implement SSR for projects.
